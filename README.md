RM Bot from 2020-2021(ish)

this repo just has the source code for the old discord bot I made for the group Roblox's Myths

the code is not very pretty nor optimal, but i was like 15 so i get an excuse

TLDR of functionality (the important stuff anyways):
- A Discord bot connected to the ROBLOX game that primarily did the following:
  - Tracked the amount of activity (hours & minutes) spent by group members in the 
     game, automatically creating and uploading the information to customizable 
     spreadsheets compatible with multiple groups and discord servers
  - Allowed HRs to make announcements to all active ROBLOX servers at once with one command
  - Allowed HRs to change players' group ranks through commands
  - Allowed players to submit games for group events, all of which were compiled for 
     HRs to use
  - Used a Discord-to-ROBLOX verification system, linking their accounts
  - Automatically rank players after they complete a rank-up game on ROBLOX
  - Allowed players to post commission requests through the bot's DMs
